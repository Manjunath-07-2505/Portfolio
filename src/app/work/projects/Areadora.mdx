## Overview

The **Bank Management System** is a Java-based console application developed using **JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)** to perform essential banking operations.  
It allows users to manage bank accounts efficiently while ensuring secure interaction with a **MySQL database**.

This project focuses on implementing real-world banking functionalities such as account creation, deposits, withdrawals, and balance inquiry, while demonstrating strong backend concepts like database connectivity, exception handling, and the **DAO design pattern**.

## 🚀 Features

- **Create New Bank Accounts**: Add new customer accounts with unique account details.
- **Deposit Money**: Safely deposit funds into an existing account.
- **Withdraw Money**: Withdraw funds with proper balance validation.
- **Check Account Balance**: View real-time account balance information.
- **Secure Database Access**: Uses Prepared Statements to prevent SQL injection.
- **Structured Code Design**: Implements DAO pattern for clean separation of logic.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. The user interacts with the application via the **console interface**.
2. Input is processed in the main application class.
3. Database operations are handled through DAO classes.
4. JDBC establishes a secure connection with MySQL.
5. Results are fetched and displayed back to the user.
