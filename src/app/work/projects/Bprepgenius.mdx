## Overview

**MealMate** is a full-stack web application built using the **MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js)** that helps users manage meals and recipes efficiently.  
The platform allows users to explore food items, upload images, and interact with a responsive frontend connected to a robust backend API.

This project demonstrates real-world full-stack development concepts including REST APIs, database modeling, authentication-ready architecture, and clean frontend-backend separation.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **User-Friendly Interface**: Clean and responsive React-based frontend.
- **Backend REST API**: Built with Node.js and Express for handling requests.
- **Image Upload Support**: Stores images securely using uploads folder.
- **Modular Architecture**: Organized backend with controllers, routes, models, and middleware.
- **Environment Configuration**: Uses `.env` for secure configuration.
- **Scalable Design**: Easy to extend with authentication and AI-based features.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. The **frontend (React)** sends requests to the backend using API calls.
2. The **backend (Node + Express)** processes requests via routes and controllers.
3. Data is managed through **MongoDB models**.
4. Images are stored and served from the **uploads/images** directory.
5. Environment variables manage sensitive configuration securely.
