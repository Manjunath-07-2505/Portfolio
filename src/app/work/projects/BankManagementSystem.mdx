## Overview

**Bank Management System** is a Java-based desktop application developed using **Java Swing (JFrame)** and **JDBC** to perform essential banking operations efficiently.  
The system provides a user-friendly graphical interface for managing bank accounts and executing operations such as account creation, balance inquiry, deposits, withdrawals, fund transfers, and password management.

This project demonstrates real-world desktop application development concepts including GUI design, database connectivity, transaction management, and secure handling of financial data.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **User Registration & Login**: Secure authentication for users.
- **Create Bank Account**: Allows users to create new bank accounts.
- **Check Account Balance**: View account balance securely.
- **Deposit Money**: Add money to an account.
- **Withdraw Money**: Withdraw money with balance validation.
- **Fund Transfer**: Transfer money between accounts using transaction management.
- **Change Password**: Secure password update functionality.
- **Secure Database Access**: Uses PreparedStatement to prevent SQL injection.
- **User-Friendly GUI**: Interactive interface built using Java Swing.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. The **Login Page** authenticates users using username and password.
2. After successful login, the **Dashboard** provides access to all banking modules.
3. User inputs are collected using **Swing components** such as JTextField and JPasswordField.
4. The application connects to the database using **JDBC**.
5. SQL queries (INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE) are executed securely using **PreparedStatement**.
6. Fund transfers are handled using **JDBC transaction management** (commit & rollback).
7. Results are displayed to the user via dialog boxes and UI components.
