## Overview

**Employee Management System** is a Java-based desktop application developed using **Java Swing (JFrame)** and **JDBC** to manage employee records efficiently.  
The system provides a user-friendly graphical interface to perform core employee management operations such as adding, viewing, updating, and deleting employee details.

This project demonstrates real-world desktop application development concepts including GUI design, database connectivity, CRUD operations, and modular programming with secure database interaction.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **User-Friendly GUI**: Interactive and clean interface built using Java Swing.
- **Add Employee**: Insert new employee records into the database.
- **Fetch Employee**: Retrieve employee details using employee ID.
- **Fetch All Employees**: Display all employee records in tabular format using JTable.
- **Update Employee Details**: Update name, gender, or salary independently.
- **Delete Employee**: Remove employee records securely.
- **Secure Database Access**: Uses PreparedStatement to prevent SQL injection.
- **Modular Design**: Each functionality implemented as a separate module.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. The **Index page (Main Menu)** allows navigation between modules.
2. User inputs data through **Swing components** such as JTextField and JButton.
3. On action events, the application connects to the database using **JDBC**.
4. SQL queries (INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE) are executed using **PreparedStatement**.
5. Data is stored and retrieved from the **MySQL database**.
6. Results are displayed to the user via dialog boxes or tables.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Java** – Core programming language
- **Java Swing (JFrame)** – GUI development
- **JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)** – Database connection
- **MySQL** – Relational database
- **Eclipse IDE** – Development environment
- **WindowBuilder Plugin** – UI design
- **MySQL Connector (JAR)** – JDBC driver
- **Git & GitHub** – Version control

## ▶️ How to Run the Project

1. Open the project in **Eclipse IDE**
2. Add **MySQL Connector JAR** to the build path
3. Create the MySQL database and employee table
4. Configure database credentials in the JDBC connection code
5. Run `index.java`
6. Perform employee operations using the GUI
